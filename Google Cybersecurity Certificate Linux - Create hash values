#Goal 1 - Generate hashes for files#
/home/analyst
ls
#Two files appear - file1.txt, file2.txt#
cat file1.txt
cat file2.txt
#Answer - Yes#
sha256sum file1.txt
sha256sum file2.txt
#Answer - No#
#Goal 2 - Compare hashes#
sha256sum file1.txt >> file1hash
sha256sum file2.txt >> file2hash
cat file1.hash
cat file2hash
#Although both files seemed the same in the beginning, the hashes written to both files are completely different#
cmp file1hash file2hash
#Proves that both files are different#
